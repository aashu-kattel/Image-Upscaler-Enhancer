##Image Scaler/Enhancer leveraging Lanczos Interpolation and CLAHE Algorithm

To Run: streamlit run main.py

[

1. Lanczos Interpolation for initial upscaling
2. CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Enhances local contrast
- Preserves edge details

3. Unsharp Masking
- Sharpens image details
- Makes edges and textures more pronounced

]

The key OOP elements are:
-AdvancedImageUpscaler class
-Encapsulation of methods like unsharp_mask(), enhance_contrast(), and upscale()
-Static methods for specific image processing techniques
-Class-based approach to image enhancement

The main class AdvancedImageUpscaler contains methods that:
1. Process images
2. Perform specific transformations
3. Provide a structured approach to image upscaling

#Sharpness (Laplacian)
Variance Value	Sharpness Description:
0â€“20	- Very blurry (little edge detail)
20â€“100	- Slightly blurry to moderate
100â€“300	- Sharp and well-focused
300+	- Extremely sharp or noisy image

#Color Distribution
What You See	What It Means
ðŸ”´ High red %	Warm image (sunset, people, fire, etc.)
ðŸŸ¢ High green %	Nature-heavy (trees, plants, grass)
ðŸ”µ High blue %	Cool tone (sky, sea, tech scenes)
Equal-ish %	Well-balanced or neutral image

#Color Histogram
- Useful for auto-adjustment algorithms.
- Can detect if an image is too dark or too bright before enhancement.

Benefits of the 3 stats:
1. Color Histogram --> Color Gradin: See if shadows, midtones, and highlights are balanced.
2. Sharpness (Variance of Laplacian) --> Preprocessing: Designers building AI tools (e.g., dataset curation) can filter images programmatically.
3. Color Distribution --> Brand Compliance: Confirm your design leans toward brandâ€™s official palette.
